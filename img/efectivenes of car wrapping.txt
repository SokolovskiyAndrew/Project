Are vehicle wraps effective?
When you think of marketing techniques, the use of vehicle graphics may not be the first thing that comes to mind. However, you may want to give car wrapping more consideration based on the following statistics:

In the US today, “individual vehicle advertising generates between 30,000-70,000 daily vehicular impressions,” according to ARD Ventures.
“Mobile advertising generates 2.5 times more attention than a static billboard,” says Perception Research.
“Messages on outdoor mobile billboards have a 97% recall rate,” RYP & Becker Group indicates.
Based on these metrics, it’s easy to see why small business owners would want to consider choosing vehicle wraps over more traditional forms of advertising.
